# Manual UI Verification Tasks (Non-blocking)

This file is a queue of manual UI verification checks that QA could not perform headlessly.

Rules:
- Each item MUST map to a specific feature/work unit (tie it back to the task card).
- Include exact "what to verify" plus refs (files, run folder, bundle path, commit hash).
- Checking items off is a human action; add evidence/notes inline when completed.

## Open items

- [ ] (example) <feature/work unit> — <what to verify> (refs: <files>, <run folder>, <bundle>, <commit>)

## Completed (optional)

Move checked items here if you want to keep "Open items" short.
