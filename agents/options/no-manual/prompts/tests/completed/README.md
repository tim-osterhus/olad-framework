# Completed QA Smoketest Artifacts (`agents/prompts/tests/completed/`)

This folder stores smoketest artifacts that were used in QA runs that ended with `### QA_COMPLETE`.

## Rules

- Do not edit files in this folder.
- To reuse a completed smoketest:
  1) Copy it back into `agents/prompts/tests/` with a NEW `NNN-<slug>.md` filename.
  2) Edit the copy and run it as part of the new QA cycle.
